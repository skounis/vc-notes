## In-Depth Articles
### [EU Wallet In Depth #1: Trusted Lists](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eu-wallet-depth-1-trusted-lists-andrew-tobin/)  
Challenges:
* Number of Trusted Lists and Architectural Complexity
* Internationalization
* Trusted List of Trusted Lists  
_Possible primary ecosystem attack vector_
* Who polices the Trusted Lists 

Highlights:

> Any bad actor will head straight for the trusted lists as the first attack vector. They are the root of trust. Hacking a trusted list will mean a bad actor can impersonate a legitimate credential issuer or verifier. They could literally print their own digital passports. Or they could release a rogue wallet app to the appstores, which would appear to be a genuine, certified, and approved app.

> The design and build of credential ecosystems are 75% governance rules and 25% technology. 

#### Trusted List Example
*  [EBSI Trusted Issuers List](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSIDOC/Issuers+trust+model+-+Accreditation+of+Issuers)

### [EU Wallet In Depth #2: No PID, No Problem.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eu-wallet-depth-2-pid-problem-andrew-tobin/)  
Highlights:

> The EUDIW can be used for all sorts of use cases without the citizen having to first load it with a government-certified identity credential (`PID`)

#### eIDAS 2
* [Explanatory Memorandum](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281)

### [EU Wallet In Depth #3: Conscious Decoupling?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eu-wallet-dept-3-conscious-decoupling-andrew-tobin/)
Challenges
* credential tracking in government-certified and approved wallet apps
* best privacy capabilities for our citizens
* decoupling of issuers and verifiers


Highlights:

> This means that the issuer of QEAAs cannot track where a holder (a citizen) is using their credentials. It is vital to ensure that a privacy wall exists between the issuer and the verifier (or “relying party”).

> There will be less regulatory oversight of non-qualified issuers
