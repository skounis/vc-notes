## Libraries
* [Verifiable Credentials JS Library (@digitalbazaar/vc)](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/vc-js)
* [did-jwt-vc](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-jwt-vc) - Create and verify W3C Verifiable Credentials and Presentations in JWT format
* [Verifiable Credential Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cef-ebsi/verifiable-credential) - Create and verify EBSI-compliant W3C Verifiable Credentials in JWT format.
* [Identity.com Verifiable Credential Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@identity.com/credential-commons) - Javascript Library provides functionality around Verifiable Credentials (VC) `WIP`
* [ethr DID Resolver](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ethr-did-resolver)  
This library is intended to use ethereum addresses or secp256k1 publicKeys as fully self-managed [Decentralized Identifiers](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#identifier) and wrap them in a [DID Document](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#did-document-properties)
* [SIOP-OpenID4VP](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/SIOP-OpenID4VP)  
Maybe interesting to have a look at it and their SDK (for future backlog item)
